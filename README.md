ReactiveUI basics

This repository covers the basics; setting up the bootstrapper, bindings and routing. 
The demo just takes a username and password and has a side menu to change views.

Still trying to figure out if using Caliburn.Micro is a good idea, 
the only benefit i see is property auto-wiring when doing simple views. 
If you see an error on the code or a better approach please write a comment.
