ReactiveUI basics

TL;DR
This repository covers the basics; setting up the bootstrapper, bindings and routing. 
The demo just takes a username and password and has a side menu to change views.

WPF ReactiveUI Binding and Routing Tutorial Reactive UI clearly helps to write cleaner and more intuitive code, you just have to get used to bindings and thinking about Observables. There’s a lot of information and projects about Reactive UI but i didn’t find any project/tutorial showing a “complete” build just stubs or code excerptions.

Still trying to figure out if using Caliburn.Micro is a good idea, the only benefit i see is property auto-wiring when doing simple views. If anyone has a good link for using both (Caliburn.Micro and ReactiveUI) don’t hesitate to tell me!. If you see an error on the code or a better approach please raise an issue or a pull request.
